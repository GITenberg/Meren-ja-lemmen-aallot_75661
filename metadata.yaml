summary: '"Meren ja lemmen aallot" by Franz Grillparzer is a play written in the early
  20th century, which explores themes of love, destiny, and the duties of priesthood
  through the lens of Greek mythology. The story centers around the character Hero,
  a priestess of Aphrodite, as she prepares for a significant ceremony and reflects
  on her past, relationships, and the influence of love in her life.  The opening
  of the play establishes a lively temple setting in Sestos where Hero sets about
  preparing for a festival honoring the goddess Aphrodite. As she engages with Ianthe
  and the temple staff, Hero grapples with her emotions and the weight of her priestly
  responsibilities, which starkly contrast with her yearning for personal connection.
  The arrival of her family adds complexity to her inner conflict as Hero''s past
  interactions and unresolved feelings surface, hinting at future challenges she may
  face in reconciling her duties as a priestess with her human desires for love and
  companionship, notably as she interacts with two young men, Naukleros and Leander,
  who represent the allure of the outside world. (This is an automatically generated
  summary.)'
